## Data Story Project Overview
In this project, we worked as a team to create a digital analytics story. We used Power BI to model and create visualizations to represent a story that you are interested in investigating. 
We identified a problem/question/description that we were interested in investigating. We then then researched data sets that were available that helped with shedding light on the area that we interested in.  

The Data Story Project contains the following sections: 
- Problem Statement
- Approach
- Dataset
- Benefits Implications
